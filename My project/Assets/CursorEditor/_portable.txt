The application behaves in portable way if
* portable.txt file exists in the application folder OR
* if there is an AppData subfolder in the application folder.

To cancel portable mode, delete the the AppData folder AND rename portable.txt
file to something else (for example _portable.txt).

In portable mode, all information is stored in the AppData folder.
